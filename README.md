# AV-Marinus
The name Cormorant is a contraction derived from the Latin corvus marinus: "sea raven".

This font is an exploration in achieving optical marginal alignment through the use of the opentype feature justification alternates.  The purpose in exploring justification alternates for marginal alignment is to produce the same capabilities within LibreOffice that are available in a professional typesetting system. 

However, early testing suggests that while justification alternates function within LibreOffice, the use of jalt for the hyphenation glyph hyphen-minus creates unusual behavior. So, this font, which is besides the jalt feature a duplicate of Cormorant, has no purpose without the jalt feature.  And the jalt feature in AV-Marinus has no purpose in LibreOffice until it can include the hyphen.

So, This font is on haitus, likely permanent. 

Additionally, While Cormorant is a beautiful font, my metrics on it make it hard to love for press printing. The serifs and minor strokes fall into the range that a high quality press is going to send alarms on the low width seen. That is, at an actual capital height of 7pts (a common size for dense books like Scripture) the serifs are .22 pts , and the minor strokes 
are .23pts. A quarter point (.25pts) is a limit that a good prepress is going to flag. So, Cormorant may be usable for larger text sizes, it is marginal to unusable for press printing at low text sizes. All this is to say that IF I come back to optically aligned text via contextual alternates, EB Garamond will likely be the source font used, even if it provides (slightly) less global coverage.
